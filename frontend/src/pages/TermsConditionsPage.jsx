                itinertrip does not have any control over the airlines'
                allocation of seats. If you have particular seat requests, you
                should check-in at the airport as early as possible and make the
                request directly at the airport counter. itinertrip also does
                not provide the insurance for our flight tickets, but if you
                want to cover your flight with the insurance, you may contact
                the airline directly. This terms and conditions will also be

                <b className="me-1">v. Direct Flight and One-Stop Flight</b>
                The direct flight is a condition when the flight travels
                directly from departure to arrival destination without causing
                passenger to switch the airplane. But, in the case of a switch
                flight event is the responsibility of the Airline, but please,
                note that a flight described on your flight ticket as "direct"
                will not necessarily be non-stop. A flight that is described as
                direct is one where there is no need to change aircraft during
                the journey. "One-stop" Flight is a condition when transit
                occurs at one point within the scale of your departure to your
                arrival destination. itinertrip provide "One-stop" flight option
                in which including the same or different airline. For "One-stop"
                flight, you will be given 2 bookings. You have to collect your
                baggage and go through check-in twice, since you are taking 2
                different flights to reach your final destination and stopping
                at a transit station. For International flights, you need to go
                through immigration checking. It is important for you to fully
                understand the risks of purchasing a "one-stop" flight. The
                planned delay or cancellation of one flight segment by the
                airline and causing you to miss your connecting flight, will be
                completely your responsibility and definitely not our
                (itinertrip.com) responsibility.
                <b className="me-1">vi. Return Flight</b>

                (either departure or return flight) are subject to refund policy
                by each airline. If departure and return flight booking are
                using different airlines, then the refund request will be
                categorized as separated booking and complied to the airlines

                this issue with the airline as their rules may vary and you must

                date of their return flight in order to be entitled to the
